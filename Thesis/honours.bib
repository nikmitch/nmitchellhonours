For $d=1$ particularly powerful results are available using conformal field theory. These are checked against those available from solvable models. They may be explained in terms of a picture, valid more generally, whereby quasiparticles, entangled over regions of the order of the correlation length in the initial state, then propagate classically through the system.},

  Abstract                 = {The evolution of correlations in the exactly solvable Luttinger model (a model of interacting fermions in one dimension) after a suddenly switched-on interaction is analytically studied. When the model is defined on a finite-size ring, zero-temperature correlations are periodic in time. However, in the thermodynamic limit, the system relaxes algebraically towards a stationary state which is well described, at least for some simple correlation functions, by the generalized Gibbs ensemble recently introduced by Rigol et al. (cond-mat/0604476). The critical exponent that characterizes the decay of the one-particle correlation function is different from the known equilibrium exponents. Experiments for which these results can be relevant are also discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {In this Letter we pose the question of whether a many-body quantum system with a full set of conserved quantities can relax to an equilibrium state, and, if it can, what the properties of such a state are. We confirm the relaxation hypothesis through an ab initio numerical investigation of the dynamics of hard-core bosons on a one-dimensional lattice. Further, a natural extension of the Gibbs ensemble to integrable systems results in a theory that is able to predict the mean values of physical observables after relaxation. Finally, we show that our generalized equilibrium carries more memory of the initial conditions than the usual thermodynamic one. This effect may have many experimental consequences, some of which have already been observed in the recent experiment on the nonequilibrium dynamics of one-dimensional hard-core bosons in a harmonic potential [T. Kinoshita et al., Nature (London) 440, 900 (2006)].},
